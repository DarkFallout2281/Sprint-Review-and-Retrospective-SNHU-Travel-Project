# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective-SNHU-Travel-Project
### Reflection Questions

1. **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
   I interpret user needs by engaging with stakeholders through feedback sessions to understand their goals, as seen with the client’s vision for niche vacation packages. User stories break these needs into actionable tasks (e.g., “As a user, I want to filter deals by price to find affordable options”), providing clarity and prioritization. This approach ensured the SNHU Travel platform met user expectations through iterative development and testing.

2. **How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
   I approach program development by breaking projects into iterative cycles, using version control (e.g., Git) and testing early and often. For SNHU Travel, Agile processes like sprint planning and Daily Scrums kept the team aligned. In the future, I aim to incorporate Scrum sprints, retrospectives for continuous improvement, and backlog refinement to adapt to evolving requirements, ensuring efficient and user-focused development.

3. **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
   A good team member communicates clearly, collaborates effectively, and takes accountability for their work. In the SNHU Travel project, I contributed by facilitating Daily Scrums, clarifying requirements, and testing features. Supporting teammates, respecting diverse perspectives, and actively participating in Agile ceremonies like retrospectives fosters a productive team environment, driving project success.
